# Usage
Admins can access Equipment database and users database.  
Users can only view items that are available to rent (white background) or
are rented by them (green when they still have time to give the item back or red background when they exceed rental time)
or are waiting for approval to be rented by them (yellow background).  
Admins can: delete and approve users, delete and add items, approve/disapprove item renting and modify rental period on approval.  
Users (after being approved by an admin) can ask to rent an item by selecting it, choosing the rental period and waiting for admin approval.
